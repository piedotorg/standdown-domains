# Affiliate Network Rules

This repository contains a **JSON file** that defines rules for handling **affiliate network tracking links**. It includes patterns to identify various affiliate networks and specifies how they should be processed. We publish these rules to promote **transparency** in how we handle Stand-down, rather than pushing for a universal standard that everyone must adopt.

## **afsrc=1: The Preferred Industry Standard**

For over a decade, `afsrc=1` has served as a well-recognized standard in affiliate marketing. It offers a simple, universal way to signal the source of affiliate traffic, thereby ensuring accurate tracking and attribution. Ideally, **all advertisers and publishers** would consistently include `afsrc=1` in their affiliate links. Doing so eliminates the need for maintaining large, ever-changing lists of affiliate network rules.

- **Responsibility:** Publishers and advertisers should add `afsrc=1` to their links to clearly indicate affiliate sources.
- **Benefits:** When used universally, `afsrc=1` streamlines tracking, reduces confusion, and makes it easier for all parties to follow Stand-down policies.

However, because not all publishers follow this best practice, we continue to maintain and share our Stand-down rules for transparency.

## **What is Stand-down?**

Affiliate networks have long implemented policies‚Äîoften referred to as **"standing down"**‚Äîto manage the complexities of last-click attribution and commission credit allocation. Over time, different networks have developed varied, often convoluted methods to address these challenges. In our approach, we‚Äôve taken the most conservative stance possible to ensure a consistent experience across the board.

While the Stand-down policy itself is not new, its implementation can be inconsistent. That‚Äôs why we are pushing for **afsrc=1** as the industry standard for affiliate tracking. With afsrc=1, all parties benefit from a clear and streamlined system that simplifies attribution and reduces the need for maintaining complex Stand-down rules.

### **Why does it matter?**
When a shopper is already affiliated with a cash back provider, creator, or publisher, it's important that other extensions or publishers do not market additional offers. This universal Stand-down approach ensures that attribution works as expected for all parties, providing a consistent and transparent experience for both users and affiliate partners.

### **Example Scenario**
A user has two cash back browser extensions installed. If they activate cash back in the first extension, the second extension **must not**:  
- Show a pop-up or notification asking them to activate cash back  
- Display banners or other marketing to encourage activation  
- Attempt to overwrite the original affiliate tracking  

By **following Stand-down rules**, we ensure that **cash back tracking remains fair and transparent** for shoppers, affiliates, and publishers.

### **What does "marketing to" mean?**
- Displaying a **pop-up** to activate cash back  
- Showing **banners** or notifications promoting activation  
- Attempting to **overwrite the original cash back tracking**

## **Why We Publish Our Stand-down Rules**

We believe that, ideally, **`afsrc=1`** should be universally adopted so that no Stand-down list is necessary. However, because not all affiliate networks or publishers implement it consistently, we maintain this **JSON file** to provide clarity on how we handle Stand-down events. This allows anyone‚Äîpublishers, advertisers, or other developers‚Äîto see exactly how we process affiliate links in the absence of `afsrc=1`.

While we encourage the community to contribute to this file and use it as a resource, we see **`afsrc=1`** as the true, easy-to-use standard that already exists. Our hope is that more networks will **educate and enforce** its usage.

For more details on how we can streamline attribution, please check out our blog post [Embracing afsrc=1: A New Approach to Affiliate Tracking](https://www.pie.org/blog/embracing-afsrc-1). In the post, we focus on the need for stronger **`afsrc=1`** enforcement and explore ideas like first-click attribution. Our hope is that more networks will adopt and enforce **`afsrc=1`**, leading to a more consistent and transparent affiliate ecosystem.

## **Stand-down Types & Implementation Responsibility**

Stand-down enforcement can vary based on the level of restriction required by the affiliate network. There are two primary enforcement levels:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Notag**
- **Meaning:** The extension **cannot apply an affiliate tag** but may still display some functionality (e.g., coupons).  
- **Allowed:**  
  - Displaying coupons  
  - Showing non-affiliate-related functionality  
- **Not Allowed:**  
  - Overwriting an existing affiliate tag  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Stop**
- **Meaning:** The extension **must not show any functionality** related to cash back or rewards.  
- **Not Allowed:**  
  - Displaying cash back pop-ups or banners  
  - Allowing manual cash back activation  
  - Showing coupons or rewards  

### **üö® Responsibility of Implementation**
Using this Stand-down file **does not automatically enforce compliance**.  
- **Implementers** (browser extensions, shopping tools, publishers, etc.) must ensure that their product **respects the appropriate Stand-down level**.  
- Failure to respect Stand-down rules may result in **violations of affiliate network agreements**.
